===========

Flipinstock lets you track a product's availability status on Flipkart. Developed especially for the purpose, when the product is out of stock on Flipkart and there is a huge demand for it. If the product is out of stock, it informs users the moment product gets available.

Whenever the product gets available, it notifies users, by the method that they have chosen, and terminates when all the queried products have been reported to be in stock.

It can use the following applications to notify users, apart from system-notification and terminal:

	- Firefox
	- Mplayer
	- Google Chrome

For multiple products search, notification window won't show up until all the products have been reported to be in stock.
However, availibilty of each product will be notified individually by the system-notification, terminal and the apps chosen by the users.
